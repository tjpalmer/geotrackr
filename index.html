          Moscow is the capital of Russia and its most populous city.
          Monastic chronicles first reference Moscow in 1147, and it became the
          center of the Russian state in 1478.
          It again has been the Soviet and Russian capital since 1918.
          Moscow is also the headquarters of the Russian Orthodox Church.
